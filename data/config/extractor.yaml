# this data pertains to reading the first N characters of a file and storing it
# as part of the `head_and_mode` part of a document
read_head:
  # read 1000 characters
  length: 1000

  # these filename patterns are handled
  # any other files will have
  #   head: null

  # this avoids attempting to read non-text data from images and other
  # binary filetypes

    - "*.sh"

  # reading the head
  # if this pattern is found, then the text is taken starting
  # after that preamble
